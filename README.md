# Is Aviation Safe? - An Air Accidents & Safety Analysis and Prediction

*  What's inside: A global airline data base analysis  based on commecial aircraft accidents extracted from ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) API, over the last 15 years (jan2008-may2022), along with an air crahes Machine Learning classifier predicition model.

* The link from original ICAO API source is available below:

* Goals: Answering the question 'Is aviation safe?' through risks and probabilites analysis involved in the mentioned accidents, as well as creating a predictor capable to foreseen air disasters possibilities.

* IMPORTANT DEFINITION - Air Incident / Air Accident difference: 
  Air Incident: is any event involving one or more airplanes that some how put goods or human lives at risk. 
  Air Accident: is an incident which caused serious damage, injury or fatal victims.

* After all 15 datasets preparation (one dataset per year) 1507 air accidents, and only in scheduled commercial flights,  were considered on this analysis.
